# Awesome Feijoa, Date and Ginger Loaf

## Classification
Dairy Free, Nut Free, Vegan.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup feijoas, peeled and diced
- 150g dates, chopped
- 100g crystallised ginger, chopped
- 250ml boiling water
- 150g brown sugar
- 50g olive margarine
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 270g flour
- 1 tbsp ginger
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda

## Steps
- Pre-heat the oven to 180Â°C on bake and grease a loaf tin.
- Place the feijoa, dates, ginger, water, margarine and sugar into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool.
- Sift together the flour, ginger, baking powder and soda and add to the fruit mixture once cooled along with the egg and vanilla. Do not over mix (this mixture is quite thick).
- Spoon the mixture into the greased tin and bake for 45 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean.

## Substitutions

- We haven't tried it with egg replacer, but I would imagine the nature of how moist this loaf is you will be fine with a powder alternative.
