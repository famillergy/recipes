# The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies Ever

## Classification
Dairy Free, Nut Free, Egg Free, Vegan.


## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup soy/rice milk
- 1 tsp vanilla or vanilla paste
- 12 oz/340 grams dairy-free chocolate chips

In a medium bowl place the creamy ingredients:
- 1 cup of softened margarine
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/2 cup sugar

In another medium bowl place the dry ingredients:
- 2 1/4 cups flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking soda

## Steps
- With a hand mixer, blend together the margarine and sugars. Once blended, add the soy
milk and vanilla.
- Mix well; the mixture should be a creamy consistency.
- Add the dry ingredients to the creamy ingredients, mix with hand mixer or with a wooden
spoon.
- Fold in the chocolate chips.
- Drop spoonfuls of dough onto a greased or parchment paper lined baking sheet. (I like to use a tablespoon to scoop up the dough and make them consistent in size.)
- Bake at 350F/180C for about 8-10 minutes or until edges are brown. (If you like chewy cookies, take them out of the oven right as the edges turn light brown.)

## Substitutions

- We use rice milk instead of soy milk, and it comes out a bit more nutty flavoured
- For Dairy-free chocolate in New Zealand, we use Whittakers Dark Chocolate and break up the block into pieces and then cut up the pieces.
